- Core functions of the **CPU** (**fetch-decode-execute cycle**): 
	- **Fetch**: fetches the instruction from the memory (**RAM**)
	- **Decode**: understand what the instruction is telling the CPU what to do.
	- **Execute**: carry out the instruction.

- Key Parts of the **CPU**:
	- **Arithmetic Logic Unit** (**ALU**)
		- math: performs basic math (add, subtract) and logic operations (**AND**, **OR**, **NOT**)
		- also used for comparison (e.g., is A > B?).
	- **Registers**
		- Small, fast memory inside the **CPU**. Stores data being worked on right now.
		- examples:
			- **Program Counter**: tracks the address of the next instruction.
			- **Accumulator**: stores intermediate results.
	- **Cache**
		- Very fast memory close to the CPU cores.
		- frequently used data and instructions are stored here to avoid slow access to **RAM**.
