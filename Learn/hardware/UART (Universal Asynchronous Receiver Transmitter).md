- Protocol for data exchange between two devices.
- It uses the *TX* (transmitter) and the *RX* (receiver) pin.
- Communication is:
	- **Asynchronous**: the **baud rate** is established (how many bits per seconds can be exchanged), no shared clock signal is needed.
	- **Serial**: data is sent one bit at a time.
	- **Full-duplex**: data can be sent and received at the same time.
