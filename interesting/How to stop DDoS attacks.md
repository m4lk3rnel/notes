- **Increase bandwidth:** Increasing the bandwidth can help you withstand a DDoS attack or mitigate it altogether, but may not be cost-effective.

- **Change IP addresses/ranges:** Changing your IP address and DNS information can stop the attack temporarily until the attacker targets the new IP address. In addition, several internal systems would need to be changed to reflect the new IP address.

-  **Hire Cybersecurity Experts**
	-   Security consultants, [managed detection and response](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/managed-detection-and-response-mdr/) (MDR) experts, and other professionals should be contacted to help stop the attack, improve systems against future attacks, and recommend other [incident response tools](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/best-incident-response-tools-services/) and services.
	
-  **Cloud services** 
	-   Cloud-based [DDoS protection services](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/products/distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-protection-vendors/) often provide the most comprehensive option to block DDoS attacks, so organizations will often migrate some or all of their infrastructure to a cloud provider like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.
	
-  Reviewing log files will often give you valuable information, like **IP addresses**.

-  **IP filtering**
	- **IP filtering** will allow you to block specific IP addresses.
- **Geo-blocking**
	- **Geo-blocking** will allow you to block connections from a geographic location
	
- **DDoS protection on routers:** Enabling this helps protect your network against DDoS by monitoring the number of traffic packets entering your network.

- **Rate limiting:** Rate limiting is a security feature that limits the number of requests that can be made in a specific timeframe.

- **Stop specific requests:** If you notice you are being bombarded with a specific network request (i.e., SYN flooding), you can rate-limit the incoming connection requests.

- **Block downloads:** If a specific service is trying to download very large files, a defense might be to disable downloads temporarily without affecting the rest of the website

- **[Firewalls](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/waf/):** A firewall is a tool that monitors network traffic and enforces security policies to block suspicious network activity or malicious attacks.

- **[Secure web gateways](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/secure-web-gateway/):** This tool is similar to a firewall but primarily focuses on blocking suspicious web traffic.

- **DDoS protection appliance:** A DDoS protection appliance is a dedicated device designed to analyze network traffic to detect and stop DDoS attacks.
