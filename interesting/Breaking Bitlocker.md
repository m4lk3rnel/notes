- TPM (**Trusted Platform Module**) - is a chip on the motherboard that stores cryptographic keys for **encryption** and **decryption**.
- TPM stores the Bitlocker key.
- On boot, the key is sent to the CPU in cleartext, so the key can be sniffed.
- [Low Pin Count Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Pin_Count) is a protocol used for communication between the CPU and the TPM chip.
