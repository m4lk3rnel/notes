-  with `nmap` i could see that ports `80`, `22`, `445` (smb), `139` were open.
-  found `/development` with gobuster (the usual wordlist), there were two text files. One was saying that `jan`'s password is weak (hint for a brute forcing attack)
-  found the users `jan` and `kay` with `enum4linux` (smb)
-  found the password `armando` for the user `jan` using `hydra` for a `ssh` brute force attack.
-  after logging in to the remote machine using ssh and the credentials, i downloaded `linpeas.sh`, found a private key for the user `kay` which has **root** privileges.
-  downloaded the private key and it was encrypted so i decrypted it with JohnTheRipper. I used the decrypted passphrase and the private key to access the remote machine as `kay`. The password could be found in `pass.back` into `kay`'s home directory.
