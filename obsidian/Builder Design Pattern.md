- The **builder** design pattern is a *creational* design pattern used to *construct* complex objects *step by step*.
- **separates** the construction of an object from its representation.

- by using this pattern you avoid having lots of **contructors overloads** which lead to **unreadable** and **error-prone** code.
- used whenever you have to deal with an **object** which has multiple **optional** parameters.



### Presentation
- define a Design Pattern, first of all.
- specify the resources you used for understanding this design pattern.
- add the list of chapters we will go through at the beginning of the presentation.
- add a:
	- "when to use it & why is it useful" slide
	- "the problem it solves" slide
	- "implementation" slide (screenshots of the implementation?)
